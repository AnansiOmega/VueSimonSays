This project was built to teach myself the basics of Vue. After completing this project I learned how to setup a project with Vue, the structuring of components. I.E Template, Script, and Style. I learned how to work with state within Vue, and conditionally render items onto the screen. I also learned a bunch of things that I don't like about Vue.. Then again it could be because of my ignorance. So if you're reading this and your a big fan of Vue.

1) Why don't keyframes work when you have your styles scoped to a component?
2) Why do I need to render something from state to have onUpdated to actually update?

I had a few more issues with Vue, but I know for a fact those are issues from lack of knowledge.

Here's what I loved about Vue.

1) Being able to pass down state into your CSS stylesheet... AMAZING, opens up so much more freedom for design.
2) The structure of a component I.E Template, Script, and Style. This makes it feel a lot more like javascript and less of a framework ( makes it much more user friendly if you aren't taking advantage of the advanced features, like state, lifecycle components. )
4) The small size of the framework, and its performance ( the main reason I decided to try out Vue )


The next project will consist of creating an application with multiple components, and finding out to manage state, and passing props around from each component.
so stay tuned!
